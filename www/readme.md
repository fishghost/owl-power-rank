Built in association with GGRecon, this is a tool for the community to power rank Overwatch League teams in a way that can be tracked over time. Individual submissions will be aggregated for a rough impression of the community's combined rankings coming into (and throughout) the 2021 OWL season.  


### User Name
The user name you choose will help us avoid duplicate rankings and allow you to retrieve your last submitted power rankings at a later date. 

The user name:
- must include alphabet
- can only include english alphabet, numbers, and underscores

If you would like to prevent others from retrieving your power ranking and overwriting the latest submission, you can add an *optional* identifier of 4 or more numbers at the end following a **#**. 

A full, uniquely identified user name would look like: `fishghost#1421`. 

### Community
You can optionally select the community to which you wish to be associated. If you would like your community to be added to the list, send us a message using the Feedback button (it might take a few days to update).

Future releases will include visualizations of the aggregate community power rankings.
